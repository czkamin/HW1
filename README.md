I was confused whether we were supposed to build a website from scratch and then add a css template or css code. Or just
take a css template and edit the code and use that. Thus I decided to make a simple html with a little css code and
also take a css template make a site but with a lot more details etc....

Attached is the html...bootstrap.... css... docs.

http://czkamin.wix.com/czkamin is where I edited a css template and then read through come code via "view source" to get an idea
of the changes I was making and what not
